## Chronus Quantum (ChronusQ)
- Principle Developer / Maintainer  2014-2018
- Contributor 2018-present
- [Github](https://github.com/liresearchgroup/chronusq_public):

ChronusQ is a production quantum chemistry software package 
written in C++11 specializing in electronic dynamics and 
relativistic effects in molecular quantum mechanics. It
was the primary deliverable from my Ph.D research and is
currently maintained by the Li Research Group.

I will contribute to the project, primarily in the context of
novel solvers for diagoanlization / inverse problems.

## CXXBLACS
- Developer / Maintainer
- [Github](https://github.com/wavefunction91/CXXBLACS)

CXXBLACS is a simple C++11 wrapper for the FORTRAN BLACS library
used in ScaLAPACK / PBLAS. It also contains wrappers for a subset
of ScaLAPACK / PBLAS and added some functionality to ease 
distributed linear algebra (distribution from node to the grid,
etc).

## HAXX
- Developer / Maintainer
- [Github](https://github.com/wavefunction91/HAXX)

HAXX (Hamilton's Quaternion Algebra for CXX) is a C++14 software
infrastructure for the development of efficient scalar and
tensorial quaternion algorithms. The novelty of HAXX is that
it contained an optimized implementation of quaternionic
matrix multiplication for AVX / AVX2. 

HAXX was the product of my MolSSI software fellowship and is
still being developed.



## CMake Modules

I also curate and maintain a set of CMake modules which
target HPC software [Github](https://github.com/wavefunction91/cmake-modules).
