I'm a software engineer and computational scientist specializing in the
develoment of high-performance computational chemistry software. My interests
primarily lie at the intersection of heterogenous, accelerated computing,
computational physics, and numerical linear algebra. Currently, I am a
Principal Software Engineer in the 
[Azure Quantum Elements Group](https://quantum.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum-elements/product-overview)
at Microsoft, where I am the Technical Lead for the 
Accelerated DFT product.

Over the years, I've architected and/or contributed to a number of computational
chemistry software packages, including 
[NWChemEx](https://github.com/NWChemEx),
[Chronus Quantum (ChronusQ)](https://www.chronusquantum.org), 
[Psi4](https://psicode.org),
[Massively Parallel Quantum Chemistry (MPQC)](https://mpqc.org)
and 
[Gaussian](https://gaussian.com/).
I've also developed a number of open-source computational chemistry libraries
providing reusable software components, including
[GauXC](https://github.com/wavefunction91/GauXC),
[ExchCXX](https://github.com/wavefunction91/ExchCXX),
[IntegratorXX](https://github.com/wavefunction91/IntegratorXX),
and [MACIS](https://github.com/wavefunction91/MACIS). Please see
my [Software]({{ site.url}}/software) page for an up-to-date list of my current development
efforts.

From 2018-2024, I was a Scientist in the
[Applied Computing for Scientific Discovery Group (ACSD)](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/amcr/computational-science-dept/acsd) of the 
[Applied Mathematics and Computational Research Division (AMCR)](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/amcr)
at [Lawerence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL)](https://lbl.gov/).
My research at LBNL centered around the development of exascale electronic structure
methods and software targeting Leadership Computing Facilities (LCF) run
by the US Department of Energy. 
I received my Ph.D. in Chemistry at the University of Washington in 2018 in the group of 
[Xiaosong Li](http://depts.washington.edu/ligroup). 
My graduate research primarily centered around methods development in the
field of quantum chemistry, specifically relativistic electronic structure theory
and modular response theory.
