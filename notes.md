This page (will) contain a number of "living notes" that I maintain either
as supplementary documentation to the software I develop or to provide clear
derivations of quantities I found non-trival when I first encoundered them.
All notes are also maintained in public GitHub repositories, so if you find
mistakes / want to add something, make an Issue or PR!

# Spinor DFT 
- [PDF]({{ site.url  }}/_assets/spinor_dft.pdf)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/wavefunction91/DFTNotes)

These notes provide the definitions and derivations of XC-related quantities for
spinor (2-component) DFT calculations, and their systematic reduction to UKS/RKS.
These terms are the expected inputs and outputs of the [GauXC](https://github.com/wavefunction91/GauXC) library.
Not complete in their current form, but are a continuing work in progress. If
there's a term that's not added that you would like to see, please open an
Issue!
