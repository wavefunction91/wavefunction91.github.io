Today, I recieved a full pass on my General Exam which allows
me to continue my graduate research and makes me a candidate
to receive a Ph.D. from the University of Washington graduate
school. Both my written proposal as well as the slides to my 
proposal talk may be found on [Github](https://github.com/wavefunction91/GeneralExam).
