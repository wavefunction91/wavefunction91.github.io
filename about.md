Currently I am a Research Scientist in the 
[Computational Chemisty, Materials & Climate Group (CCMC)](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/amcr/computational-science-dept/ccmc) in the 
[Applied Mathematics and Computational Research Division(AMCR)](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/amcr)
at [Lawerence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL)](https://lbl.gov/), 
([work webpage](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/amcr/computational-science-dept/ccmc/staff/staff-members/david-williams-young)).
My current projects center around massively parallel algorithms for electrionic structure theory.


I recieved my Ph.D. in Chemistry at the University of Washington in 2018 under the supervision
of Professor [Xiaosong Li](http://depts.washington.edu/ligroup). 
My graduate research primarily centered around methods development in the
field of quantum chemistry, specifically electronic structure theory. During my time at the University
of Washington, I had the privlidge of contributing to several quantum chemistry software packages, namely
Chronus Quantum (ChrounsQ) and Gaussian. From 2017-2018, I was a [software fellow](http://molssi.org/2018-phase-ii-molssi-software-fellows/) 
through the Molecular Sciences Software Institute ([MolSSI](http://molssi.org)).
