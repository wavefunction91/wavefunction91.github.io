Althogh there is a wealth of literature regarding the theory and the
development of approximate quantum mechanical methods and their applcation
to molecular systems, there is a void regarding the practical implementation
of these methods. Too often are crutial theoretical points "left to the
reader", assuming a certain level of expertise of the reader. As one of the
principle developers of the ChronusQ software package, I have run into
this realization more often than most. As I further my knowledge of the
practical implementation of these methods, I will post on some of the more
challenging and "non-obvious" topics in the field and hope to partially
fill that void where I can.

I am open to post about topics that are suggested, so feel free to contact me at the email at the bottom of this page.
