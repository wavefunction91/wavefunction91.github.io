Currently I am a postdoctoral scholar in the 
[Scalable Solvers Group (SSG)](https://crd.lbl.gov/departments/applied-mathematics/scalable-solvers/) in the 
[Computational Research Division (CRD)](https://crd.lbl.gov/)
at [Lawerence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL)](https://lbl.gov/), where I am advised by Chao Yang. 
([work webpage](http://crd.lbl.gov/departments/applied-mathematics/scalable-solvers/members/postdoctoral-researchers/david-williams-young/)).
My current 
projects center around massively parallel algorithms for eigenvalue problems which arise in electrionic structure
theory.


I recieved my Ph.D. in Chemistry at the University of Washington in 2018 under the supervision
of Professor [Xiaosong Li](http://depts.washington.edu/ligroup). 
My graduate research primarily centered around methods development in the
field of quantum chemistry, specifically electronic structure theory. During my time at the University
of Washington, I had the privlidge of contributing to several quantum chemistry software packages, namely
Chronus Quantum (ChrounsQ) and Gaussian. From 2017-2018, I was a [software fellow](http://molssi.org/2018-phase-ii-molssi-software-fellows/) 
through the Molecular Sciences Software Institute ([MolSSI](http://molssi.org)).
