David Williams, Graduate Student, Department of Chemistry, University of Washington.

I'm currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Chemistry at the University of Washington under the supervision
of Professor [Xiaosong Li](http://depts.washington.edu/ligroup). 
My graduate research primarily centers around methods development in the
field of quantum chemistry, specifically electronic structure theory. During my time at the University
of Washington, I've had the privlidge of contributing to several quantum chemistry software packages, namely
Chronus Quantum (ChrounsQ) and Gaussian.

I am currently the principle software developer for the [Chronus Quantum (ChronusQ)](http://www.chronusquantum.org) 
software package. ChronusQ is an open-source quantum chemistry code that focuses primarily on explicly
time-dependent and unconventional SCF and post-SCF methods such as relativistic hamiltonians and the
particle-particle random phase approximation (pp-RPA). The source of the public release of ChronusQ may be found
at {% include icon-github.html username="liresearchgroup" %} / 
[chronusq\_public](http://www.github.com/liresearchgroup/chronusq_public). To gain access to the development
branch of ChronusQ, feel free to contact me or my PI (xsli@uw dot edu)
