My name is David Williams, and I am a Chemistry Ph.D. student at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA. I study under Professor Xiaosong
Li in the field of electronic structure theory. My personal research focues on the prediction of how molecular systems respond to external
perturbations, i.e. what happens if I shine a "light" on a quantum molecular system. This "light" is metaphorical of course, at this perturbation
could be a nuclear displacement, electromagnetic field, etc.

During the course of my Ph.D. research, I've had the privlidge to be one of the primary developers of the 
<a href="http://www.chronusquantum.org/">Chronus Quantum Software Package (ChronusQ) </a>. ChronusQ is a quantum chemistry software package 
that focuses on explicitly time dependant quantum mechanical methods and spectroscopic prediction. ChronusQ is not yet ready for a production
release, but code may be obtained through signing up for Beta testing on the ChronusQ <a href="http://www.chronusquantum.org/">website</a>.

Althogh there is a wealth of literature regarding the theory and the development of approximate quantum mechanical methods and their applcation
to molecular systems, there is a void regarding the practical implementation of these methods. Too often are crutial theoretical points "left 
to the reader", assuming a certain level of expertise of the reader. As one of the principle developers of the ChronusQ software package, I have
run into this realization more often than most. As I further my knowledge of the practical implementation of these methods, I will post on some 
of the more challenging and "non-obvious" topics in the field and hope to partially fill that void where I can.
