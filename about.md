I recieved my Ph.D. in Chemistry at the University of Washington in 2018 under the supervision
of Professor [Xiaosong Li](http://depts.washington.edu/ligroup). 
My graduate research primarily centered around methods development in the
field of quantum chemistry, specifically electronic structure theory. During my time at the University
of Washington, I had the privlidge of contributing to several quantum chemistry software packages, namely
Chronus Quantum (ChrounsQ) and Gaussian. From 2017-2018, I was a [software fellow](http://molssi.org/2018-phase-ii-molssi-software-fellows/) 
through the Molecular Sciences Software Institute ([MolSSI](http://molssi.org)).



I am currently the principle software developer for the [Chronus Quantum (ChronusQ)](http://www.chronusquantum.org) 
software package. ChronusQ is an open-source quantum chemistry code that focuses primarily on explicly
time-dependent and unconventional SCF and post-SCF methods such as relativistic hamiltonians and the
particle-particle random phase approximation (pp-RPA). The source of the public release of ChronusQ may be found
at {% include icon-github.html username="liresearchgroup" %} / 
[chronusq\_public](http://www.github.com/liresearchgroup/chronusq_public). To gain access to the development
branch of ChronusQ, feel free to contact me or Xiaosong Li (xsli@uw dot edu)
