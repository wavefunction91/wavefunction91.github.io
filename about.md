I'm a researcher in the field of Theoretical / Computational Chemistry,
specializing in high-performance, heterogeneous computing and relativistic
theory. My research lies at the intersection of Physics, High-Performance
Computing and Numerical Linear Algebra. Currently, my research interest include
Krylov solvers, performance portability of quantum chemistry software, sparse
linear algebra and low scaling electronic structure theory. My research program
also centers on leveraging the latest advances in modern C++ to develop clean,
modular, and extensible high-performance software.

Currently I am a Research Scientist in the 
[Applied Computing for Scientific Discovery Group (ACSD)](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/amcr/computational-science-dept/acsd) in the 
[Applied Mathematics and Computational Research Division (AMCR)](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/amcr)
at [Lawerence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL)](https://lbl.gov/), 
([work webpage](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/amcr/computational-science-dept/acsd/staff/staff-members/david-williams-young)).
My current research centers around the development of exascale electronic
structure methods. I am one of the primary developers of the [NWChemEx](https://www.exascaleproject.org/research-project/nwchemex) software
package, former architect and maintainer (current contributor) of the 
[Chronus Quantum](https://www.chronusquantum.org) software package, 
and former contributor to the [Gaussian](https://gaussian.com/) software
package. I am currently the primary developer of the [GauXC](https://github.com/wavefunction91/GauXC) and [ExchCXX](https://github.com/wavefunction91/ExchCXX)
libraries for exascale, gaussian basis DFT simulations.


I received my Ph.D. in Chemistry at the University of Washington in 2018 under the supervision
of Professor [Xiaosong Li](http://depts.washington.edu/ligroup). 
My graduate research primarily centered around methods development in the
field of quantum chemistry, specifically electronic structure theory.
